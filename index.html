<p>We live in an incredible time. The opportunity to learn are more available than ever yet we're left with a first draft nation. Tools to share pictures and 140 character trivialities abound, but tools to support well cited learning and share that learning are markedly absent. </p>

<p>Despite the oversharing of our generation, research and learning remain starkly solitary. This is an incredible missed oppurtunity. As we pursue our own passions why can't we research in the open? Share the false starts, and misconceptions before the eventual convergence on understanding. </p>

<p>Learn on purpose is a different kind of learning platform.  Learn on purpose believes there is triumph in sharing not only a final polished paper, also that context that lead to is pristine state. Share the misunderstandings, and the mistakes. Help yourself and others answer the question: How did I learn this?</p>

<p>Learn on purpose provides composable tools to research and publish your papers and their context. </p>
